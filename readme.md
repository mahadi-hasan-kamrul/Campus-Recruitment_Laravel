##Student Guide DIU: A Web-Based Collaborative Academic Platform
##Project Overview
This repository contains the complete implementation of "Student Guide DIU," a comprehensive web-based archive system developed as a final year undergraduate project in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Daffodil International University. The platform represents an innovative approach to addressing academic resource management challenges through digital collaboration.

Academic Context
Project Background
Student Guide DIU emerged from identified gaps in the existing academic resource distribution systems within the university environment. Traditional methods of sharing course materials, previous examination papers, and supplementary resources presented significant challenges for students, including:

Fragmented resource locations across multiple platforms

Time-consuming search processes for relevant materials

Limited opportunities for peer-to-peer knowledge sharing

Inefficient communication channels between students and faculty

Research Significance
This project contributes to the field of educational technology by demonstrating how structured web-based platforms can enhance academic support systems in higher education institutions. The implementation provides valuable insights into:

Digital resource management in academic settings

Collaborative learning environments

User-centric design for educational platforms

Scalable architecture for institutional deployment

Project Objectives
The primary objectives of this academic project were:

Centralized Resource Repository

Develop a unified platform for all academic materials

Organize resources by semester, course, and program type
